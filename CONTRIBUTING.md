# Contributing to the LEMONS project

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide covers:

- The [simple procedure](#simple-procedure) for contributing to the project if you just want to add new agent types without modifying the code
- The [general procedure](#general-procedure) for contributing to the project
- How to set up and test the [Python wrapper](#working-on-the-python-wrapper) and the [C++ mechanical layer](#working-on-the-c-mechanical-layer)
- What happens in [continuous integration](#continuous-integration-ci) when you open a pull request
- How [to report an issue](#reporting-issues-and-proposing-changes)


## Simple procedure

A simple option if you want to add a different type of agents (e.g., pedestrian with a backpack, etc.) consists in generating your own XML files corresponding to these new agents (following the guidelines in the paper), reviewing them carefully, and sending them to the authors of the paper along with your motivations and explanations so that they could include them into a new release of the software.


## General procedure

The `master` branch is protected: direct pushes are not allowed.
All changes must go through a pull request (PR). Here is how you should proceed:

1. On GitHub, fork the repository to create your own copy.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine, preferably on macOS or Ubuntu. On Windows, extra care is needed because the continuous integration does not run on Windows.
3. Create a new branch from `master`:
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/short-description
   ```
4. Set up the required Python and C++ environments ([detailed below](#working-on-the-python-files)).
5. Make your changes.
6. Run the hooks defined in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:
   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit run --all-files
   ```
7. Run the mechanical layer tests:
   ```bash
   cd tests/mechanical_layer
   ./run_mechanical_tests.sh
   cd ../..
   ```
8. Commit your changes.
9. Push your branch:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/short-description
   ```
10. Open a pull request on GitHub targeting `master`. The configured checks ([detailed below](#continuous-integration-ci)) will run automatically and their status will appear on the PR.

A PR is ready to merge when:

- All automated checks are green (pre-commit.ci and GitHub Actions checks).
- The code has been reviewed and approved by at least one collaborator.
- The commit history is reasonably clean.

There are two main types of checks:

- **Style and quality checks**, which enforce formatting, coding conventions, documentation rules, and basic static analysis.
- **Functional checks**, which run tests to ensure the behavior and results are correct.



## Working on the Python wrapper

To work on the Python wrapper:

1. Install Python (version 3.14).
2. Install and configure the [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager to set up the Python virtual environment with all required dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install uv
   uv sync
   ```
   This creates and manages a virtual environment for you and installs all dependencies (including development dependencies).
3. You can then modify the Python code as needed.
4. Before committing, run in the repository root:
   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit run --all-files --skip clang-tidy,clang-format,cpplint
   ```
   Here `--skip` is used to avoid running the C++-related hooks locally when you are only modifying Python code, which saves time.



## Working on the C++ mechanical layer

To work on the C++ part, you need a working C++ toolchain. On macOS this includes LLVM/Clang and CMake. The C++ mechanical layer has its own build and test workflow:

1. You first need to build the C++ project. From the repository root, run:
   ```bash
   cd src/mechanical_layer
   cmake -H. -Bbuild -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
   cmake --build build
   cd ../..
   ```
2. Modify the code as you want.
3. Run mechanical layer pre-commit hooks and tests. The tests depend on the Python wrapper, so you must set up the required Python virtual environment as explained above. Then, from the repository root:
   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit run --all-files
   cd tests/mechanical_layer
   ./run_mechanical_tests.sh
   ```
4. Additionally, you may want to visualize the outputs of the mechanical layer tests:
   ```bash
   ./make_tests_videos.sh
   ```
   The generated videos are stored in `/test/mechanical_layer/movies/`.



## Continuous Integration (CI)

For every pull request targeting `master`, two categories of automated checks run on both `macos-latest` and `ubuntu-latest` runners.

### Pre-commit checks (via [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci/) service)

The pre-commit.ci service runs most of the hooks defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, including for example:

- Spell checking ([`codespell`](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell))
- Python formatting and linting ([`ruff`, `ruff-format`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit))
- Python type checking ([`mypy`](https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy))
- Python docstring validation ([`numpydoc-validation`](https://github.com/numpy/numpydoc))
- Notebook checks and upgrades ([`nbqa-ruff`, `nbqa-pyupgrade`](https://github.com/nbQA-dev/nbQA))
- Shell formatting ([`shfmt`](https://github.com/maxwinterstein/shfmt-py))
- C/C++ formatting and style checks ([`clang-format`](https://github.com/pocc/pre-commit-hooks), [`cpplint`](https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint))

Some more complex hooks that require the C++ library built or the Python environment are skipped here and are handled instead by GitHub Actions (see below).

### GitHub Actions workflow: CI

On each pull request, GitHub Actions runs the workflow called CI (continuous integration). Here are the main steps:

1. Check out the repository.
2. Install LLVM and Graphviz (on macOS).
3. Install the latest Doxygen.
4. Set up Python, install `uv`, and synchronize dependencies.
5. Install the pre-commit hook.
6. Build the C++ mechanical layer with CMake.
7. Run selected pre-commit hooks and test scripts:
   - `check-copyright` (verify that the copyright headers are present and correctly formatted using the `.check-copyright.sh` script.)
   - [`clang-tidy`](https://github.com/pocc/pre-commit-hooks)
   - `uv-pytest` (Python configuration tests via the [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) package)
   - `test-notebooks` (Jupyter notebook tests via the local shell script `.check-notebooks.sh`, only on `macos-latest` runner)
   - `check-doxygen` (C++ documentation tests via the local shell script `.check-doxygen.sh`)
8. Run the mechanical layer tests.

All of these checks must succeed before the PR can be merged.



## Reporting issues and proposing changes

If you are unsure about an approach, open an issue and describe:

- The problem you are trying to solve.
- The proposed solution.
- Any open design questions (for example, API changes or performance implications).

Maintainers can then provide early feedback before you invest too much time in a particular direction.
