Run the app locally
===================

To set up, follow these steps after downloading the repository from `GitHub <https://github.com/odufour7/Shape.git>`__:

**1. Environment setup**

Create and activate a virtual environment using `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`__ to manage dependencies efficiently:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install uv
   uv sync


**2. Launch the app**

Start the app with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run streamlit run src/streamlit_app/app/app.py

**3. Modify the app**

If you want to modify the app or the C++ code in a clean and consistent way, you should use the `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`__  hooks defined in the .pre-commit-config.yaml file.
These hooks help ensure your code is properly formatted and passes all required checks before each commit.
Before you can use the pre-commit hooks, you need to install them. You can do this by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run pre-commit install
