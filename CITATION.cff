  The rise of large-scale events demands innovative safety tools
  to optimise crowd flow. Traditional models rely on oversimplified
  circular agents, ignoring body shape heterogeneities and thereby
  misjudging flow or crowd density. To address this gap, we present
  a software for more realistic crowd simulations. A user-friendly
  graphical interface enables the creation of 2D and 3D pedestrian
  crowds from anthropometric data. Then, a C$^{++}$ library (Python-compatible)
  handles mechanical contacts, resolving agent-to-agent and agent-to-obstacle
  collisions in 2D spaces. Users can extend simulations by integrating
  decision-making algorithms from established crowd models.
