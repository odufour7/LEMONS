        (whose shapes are compatible with anthropometric data) or crowds.

        to compute mechanical contact forces in two dimensions and then evolve the crowd according to Newton's equation of motion.

        3. **A Python interface**
        to import anthropometric data, generate and visualise crowds, and simulate their dynamics via simple calls to the C++ library.

        ### I - Pedestrian shape elaboration

        To determine a pedestrian shape, we chose to rely on medical data from the [Visible Human Project]({visible_human_proj_url}),
        consisting of slices of frozen bodies. We take the slice associated with the torso and cover it with disks:
        two for the shoulders, two for the pectoral muscles and one for the belly.

        Then, to extend that shape to other individuals in a population, we used anthropometric measurements
        from [Gordon and collaborators]({ANSURII_url}). In particular, we matched the measure of the **chest depth** using a uniform
        scaling factor for the disk radii, and the measure of the **bideltoid breadth** using an homothety on the disk centers.""")

        We use disks instead of one single ellipse or a single polygon because the physical contact is easier

        ### II - Mechanical layer

        Drawing inspiration from the [granular material literature]({granular_material_url}), all the complexity of a 3D mechanical
        contact is reduced to 2D and modelled with **damped springs** that are normal and tangential to the surface contact.
        Stick and slip mechanism is rendered using **Coulomb law**.
