Main file to run the application.

This script initializes the application, sets up the user interface, and determines
which functionality to execute based on the selected tab and the options in the sidebar.

The application includes various tabs for different functionalities, such as:
    - `One agent` (for 2D/3D agent creation and visualisation)
    - `Crowd` (for 2D/3D crowd creation, visualisation, and generation of .xml config files)
    - `Anthropometry` (for data visualisation and analysis)
    - `About` (for displaying general information about the project)

Examples
--------
To run the application, execute these commands from the root directory of the project:

>>> pip install uv
>>> uv sync
>>> uv run streamlit run src/streamlit_app/app/app.py
