    This software is a computer program designed to generate a realistic crowd from anthropometric data and
    simulate the mechanical interactions that occur within it and with obstacles.

    of free software.  You can  use, modify and/ or redistribute the software under the terms of the CeCILL-B

    that may mean  that it is complicated to manipulate,  and  that  also therefore means  that it is reserved
    for developers  and  experienced professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore
    encouraged to load and test the software's suitability as regards their requirements in conditions enabling
