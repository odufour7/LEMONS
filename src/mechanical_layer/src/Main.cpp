     * @brief The main function of CrowdMechanics, and the only one to be called when used as a library.
     *
     * It reads static and dynamic XML files,
     * stores everything and simulates the dynamics of the agents.
     *
     * @param files An array of file names. They should be given in a precise order:
     *      - Parameters (directories, time step...)
     *      - Materials (with Young's modulus and the shear modulus
     *      - Geometry (obstacles)
     *      - Agents
     *      - Agent dynamics (current kinematics, and driving forces and torques)
     *      - (optional) Agent interactions (the information about agent-to-agent and agent-to-obstacle contacts,
     *                   if any, will be used.
     *
     * @return  EXIT_SUCCESS if the program executed successfully.
     *          EXIT_FAILURE in case of issue(s) with any of the XML files' contents
