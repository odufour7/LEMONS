"""
Unit tests for the compute_moment_of_inertia function.

Tests cover:
    - Correct computation for simple polygons (square)
    - Handling of MultiPolygon geometries
    - Zero and negative weight values
    - Invalid geometry type validation
    - Area scaling consistency
    - Mass distribution in composite geometries
