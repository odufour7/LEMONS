"""
Unit tests for the from_string_to_tuple function.

Tests cover:
    - Valid string inputs (with and without parentheses, extra spaces, negative numbers, scientific notation)
    - Handling of leading/trailing whitespace
    - Invalid inputs (non-string, wrong number of elements, non-numeric values, empty string)
    - Error message validation for incorrect formats
