"""
Unit tests for the measuring methods of Agent 2D and 3D shapes.

Tests cover:
    - Correctness of 2D measurements (chest depth, bideltoid breadth) under rotation and translation
    - Correctness of 3D measurements (height, chest depth, bideltoid breadth) under rotation and translation
    - Validation of the smallest 3D height value after transformations
    - Consistency of measurements after multiple geometric operations
