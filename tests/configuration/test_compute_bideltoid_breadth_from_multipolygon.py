"""
Unit tests for the compute_bideltoid_breadth_from_multipolygon function.

Test cases cover:
    - Simple MultiPolygon with a known maximum horizontal breadth.
    - Centroid shift of the polygon (should not affect the breadth).
    - MultiPolygon containing two separated polygons.
    - Non-MultiPolygon input (should raise ValueError).
    - Degenerate case: all points vertically aligned (breadth zero).
    - Irregular polygon where the maximum horizontal breadth is not between endpoints.
