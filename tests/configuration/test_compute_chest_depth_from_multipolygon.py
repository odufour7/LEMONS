"""
Unit tests for the compute_chest_depth_from_multipolygon function.

Tests cover:
    - Simple MultiPolygon with known vertical depth
    - MultiPolygon with two separated polygons
    - Degenerate case: all points on a horizontal line (depth zero)
    - Non-MultiPolygon input (error)
    - Centroid shift invariance
    - Irregular shape with known max vertical distance at similar x
