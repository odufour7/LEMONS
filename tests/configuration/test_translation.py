"""
Unit tests for Agent translation mechanics across dimensional spaces.

Tests cover:
    - Agent's initial position is set correctly
    - Agent's position is correctly updated after translation of the 2D shapes in x and y directions
    - Agent's 3D body centroid is correctly updated after translation in x and y directions
    - Agent's 3D body centroid and lowest height are correctly updated after translation in z direction
